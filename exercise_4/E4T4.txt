In the diagram, attackers use attack instance from an untrusted public subnet to access the web app instance.
Since we already restrict the port that can access to web app instance (port 5000 only), another improvement is 
to review why do we need an instance like the attack instance in the first place.
If we really need attack instance, then we need to restrict the port that internet can connect to this instance
