Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
the web application does not need access to secret recipe S3 bucket
but its instance role has right to access all S3 resource,
include the S3 bucket which contains the secret recipe.
Justification: need to declare the specific resource that the EC2 web app allows to access
in the IAM policy.

# Poor practice 2
In the workflow, there is no need to have ingress access for web app except port 5000,
but the SecurityGroupIngress allow all request from Internet to EC2 web app. 
Justification: restrict the ingress access for EC2 web app.
