# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
Unfortunately my GuardDuty console doesn't show anything. It has been 36 hours from the attack
and there is still no finding from GuardDuty. I attached the screenshot of GuardDuty in this folder.
All settings are in the same region (us-east-1) 

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack
- i.e. what was its source of information.
Since this is an attack on EC2 web app, I find a page that explain for all type of GuardDuty
finding for EC2.
For this excercise, the finding can be: UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce as below.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-ec2.html#unauthorizedaccess-ec2-sshbruteforce

How GuardDuty may have detected this attack: As I understand, GuardDuty uses machine learning
model to detect the anomaly activities on user account.
