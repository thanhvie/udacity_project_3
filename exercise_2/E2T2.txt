Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. (High) Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway
On the instance i-0c7c5a75ebc4fe0ac, the port range 0-65535 is reachable from 
the InternetGateway igw-0f68ff80b996e0e89 from an attached ENI eni-0fcc350b71b9bb9c3.
Recommendations: You can restrict access to your instance by modifying the Security Groups or ACLs in the network path.

2. (Medium) Port 22 is reachable from an Internet Gateway
On the instance i-0c7c5a75ebc4fe0ac, the port range 22-22 is reachable 
rom the InternetGateway igw-0f68ff80b996e0e89 from an attached ENI eni-0fcc350b71b9bb9c3.
Recommendation: You can restrict access to your instance by modifying the Security Groups
or ACLs in the network path. For this project workflow, we don't need port 22.

3. (Critical) EC2 Security Group
EC2.19 Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk
This control checks whether unrestricted incoming traffic for the security groups
is accessible to the specified ports [3389, 20, 23, 110, 143, 3306, 8080, 1433, 9200, 9300,
25, 445, 135, 21, 1434, 4333, 5432, 5500, 5601, 22, 3000, 5000, 8088, 8888]
that have the highest risk. This control passes when none of the rules in a
security group allow ingress traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 for the listed ports.
Recommendations: Delete rules from a security group. We can specify access to EC2 web app
from specific ports only.

4. (High) EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)
This control checks whether your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance
metadata version is configured with Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
The control passes if HttpTokens is set to required for IMDSv2. 
The control fails if HttpTokens is set to optional.

5. (High) EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
This control checks whether EC2 instances have a public IP address.
The control fails if the publicIp field is present in the EC2 instance configuration item.
This control applies to IPv4 addresses only.
